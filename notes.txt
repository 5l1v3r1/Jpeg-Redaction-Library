Seem to have Exif & IFD reading sorted out (read makernote as a block
now). Not currently writing them out properly. (Exiftool says bad
IFD1)

Some unit tests. 

todo: 

Need to fill in API:
  Load only.
  Write current
  Redact
  Erase EXIF
  Modify EXIF. (add tag, remove tag, remove all GPS, set tag, add EXIF)
  Modify thumbnail too.
  return data, reinject data.

Bigger test suite (images from other cameras etc.)

Need to keep track of the exact length of the bit stream and pad
appropriately when writing out. Both for redaction and reversing
redaction. 

Need to handle restart markers correctly. 
(Insert them into the stream when writing out? Remove them when
decoding.)

Need to figure out why IPTC isn't working properly. 
Bad assumptions about locations where we can write? 


Describe the basic use case in the README. 

Put a license on it.
