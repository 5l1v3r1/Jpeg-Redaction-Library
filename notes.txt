# Issues

# Issue1
06/08/11 
Need to keep track of the exact length of the bit stream and pad
appropriately when writing out. Both for redaction and reversing
redaction. 

06/15/11 
Have fixed this partially, but don't record the true bit length of the 
original data, just the rounded-up length that is stored. Need to
reduce to the correct value when it's been read.

#Issue2
Need ability to remove thumbnail

#Issue3
Need ability to redact thumbnail in same way as main image.
06/21/11 Fixed

#Issue4
Need to remove exif from SSC version.
~06/19/11 Fixed 

#Issue5
Need to handle restart markers correctly. 
(Insert them into the stream when writing out? Remove them when
decoding.)

#Issue6
Enable read-write (and then redact) of IPTC.
06/22/11 Fixed writing of IPTC. Still need to edit & redact.

#Issue7
Handle full edit of Exif

#Issue8 06/21/11 
Need to support other redaction methods:
Solid colour.
Pixellate.
ImageOverlay.
06/22/11 Implemented solid grey and set as default.

#Issue9 06/22/11 
Can't handle testdata/devices/canon-1999.jpg
DHT 0 id 0
DHT 1 id 0
DHT 2 id 1
DHT 3 id 1
comp 2/3 table 2 dhts 4 AC 0 dc 0
Error: <Can't find table > at outer level

#Issue10 06/22/11 
Do ReadSOSMarker more elegantly & faster.
Now it's being scanned twice.
Go directly to AddSOMarker?

General notes.

03/16/11 
Seem to have Exif & IFD reading sorted out (read makernote as a block
now). Not currently writing them out properly. (Exiftool says bad
IFD1)

Some unit tests. 

todo: 

Need to fill in API:
  Load only.
  Write current
  Redact
  Erase EXIF
  Modify EXIF. (add tag, remove tag, remove all GPS, set tag, add EXIF)
  Modify thumbnail too.
  return data, reinject data.

Bigger test suite (images from other cameras etc.)


Describe the basic use case in the README. 

06/15/11 
Hooked up to ssc app.
