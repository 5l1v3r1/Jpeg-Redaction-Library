Seem to have Exif & IFD reading sorted out (read makernote as a block
now). Not currently writing them out properly. (Exiftool says bad
IFD1)

Some unit tests. 

todo: 

Need to fill in API:
  Load only.
  Write current
  Redact
  Erase EXIF
  Modify EXIF. (add tag, remove tag, remove all GPS, set tag, add EXIF)
  Modify thumbnail too.
  return data, reinject data.

Bigger test suite (images from other cameras etc.)
